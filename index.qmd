# About Me 

I am an Associate Professor of [Political Science](http://polisci.cofc.edu/) at the [College of Charleston](http://cofc.edu/). For academic year 2022-2023, I am the interim director of the [Master of Public Administration](https://puba.cofc.edu/) program at the College of Charleston.  

My research and teaching interests are in public policy, with a specific interest in environmental policy and politics. My work includes such areas as climate change, cultural theory, deliberation, energy, natural hazards, and the policymaking process.
