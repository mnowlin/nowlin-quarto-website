# About Me 

I am an Associate Professor of [Political Science](http://polisci.cofc.edu/) at the [College of Charleston](http://cofc.edu/). For academic year 2022-2023, I am the interim director of the [Master of Public Administration](https://puba.cofc.edu/) program at the College of Charleston.  

**Please see my [cv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm5uajd5txnhg6v/nowlin-cv-short.pdf?dl=0)**. 

My [research](https://www.matthewcnowlin.com/research.html) and [teaching](https://www.matthewcnowlin.com/teaching.html) interests are in public policy, with a specific interest in environmental policy and politics. My work includes such areas as theories of the policy process, policy learning, belief systems (specifically cultural theory), deliberation, climate change, energy, and natural hazards.
